**Star Admin** is a free admin dashboard template built with **[Bootstrap 5](https://www.admin-dashboards.com/bootstrap-5-templates/)**. We took the original `Star Admin` and gave it a design overhaul along with newly written code to create our best template yet. This is a modern-looking dashboard with a clean and elegant design.
